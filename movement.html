    <div class="container">
      <div class="mission-statement">
        <p>
          Right now, the most powerful tools in the world are being built in a handful of places, for a handful of people. The rest of the world — the students, the small business owners, the workers, the dreamers — they're left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started SimplyLouie because we believe that's wrong. The person selling fish in Lagos deserves the same help as the tech worker in San Francisco. The student in Jakarta deserves the same advantages as the one in London.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This isn't charity. This is justice.</strong>

      <div class="section-header">
        <p class="section-eyebrow">What we stand for</p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Our Principles</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          These aren't marketing slogans. They're promises we make to ourselves and to you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="principles-grid">
        <div class="principle-card">
          <h3>Simplicity is respect</h3>
          <p>When we make things simple, we're saying your time matters. We're saying you don't need to be a tech expert to deserve good tools. Complexity is often laziness. Simplicity takes effort — and we put in that effort for you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h3>Accessible pricing is non-negotiable</h3>
          <p>We will never price SimplyLouie out of reach of the people who need it most. $2/month isn't a teaser rate or a loss leader. It's our commitment. If we can't make it work at that price, we'll find a way.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h3>Meet people where they are</h3>
          <p>If people use Telegram, we go to Telegram. If people pay with mobile money, we accept mobile money. If people have slow internet, we make it work on slow internet. We adapt to your life, not the other way around.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h3>No tech talk, no gatekeeping</h3>
          <p>We will never make you feel stupid for not knowing something. We will never use jargon to seem smart. Our job is to make you feel capable and confident, not confused and small.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h3>Dignity in every interaction</h3>
          <p>Whether you're a CEO or a student, whether you're asking about business strategy or how to write a WhatsApp message, you get the same care and respect. Everyone's problems matter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-card">
          <h3>We grow with you</h3>
          <p>As our users' needs evolve, so will we. We're not building a static product — we're building a companion that gets better at helping you over time, shaped by what you actually need.</p>
