        The most powerful technology in human history shouldn't be locked behind $20/month paywalls and English-first interfaces. SimplyLouie exists to change that.

  <!-- The Problem -->

        <span class="section-eyebrow">The problem we see</span>
        <h2>AI has a fairness problem</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          Right now, the best AI tools cost $20 or more per month. They're designed for people with stable incomes in wealthy countries. They assume you have fast internet, the latest phone, and fluent English.
        </p>
        <p>
          That leaves out <strong>billions of people</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The student in Jakarta who could use AI to study but can't afford it. The small business owner in Lagos who could grow faster with AI help. The freelancer in Nairobi competing against people with better tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't just unfair. It's dangerous. AI is becoming the most important tool in the world. If only wealthy people can use it, the gap between rich and poor will grow even wider.

      </header>

      <div class="card-grid">
        <article class="card">
          <h3>Price for local reality</h3>
          <p>$2 might seem cheap to someone in San Francisco. But we know it's real money in Lagos, Cebu, and Nairobi. We price for the places we serve.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Simple beats clever</h3>
          <p>We don't add features to seem impressive. We remove friction. Every interaction should feel like talking to a helpful friend — not wrestling with software.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Meet people where they are</h3>
          <p>Telegram works on old phones, slow networks, and limited data. That's why we're there. Help should come to you.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Respect intelligence</h3>
          <p>You don't need a degree to be smart. Our users are brilliant — they just need tools that help them do what they already know how to do, faster.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>No dark patterns</h3>
          <p>No tricks to keep you subscribed. No confusing pricing. No guilt when you cancel. We earn your business every month by being genuinely helpful.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Human warmth</h3>
          <p>Technology doesn't have to feel cold. Louie is calm, encouraging, and never judgmental. Like a patient friend who happens to know a lot.</p>

            Saint Bernard dogs are famous for one thing: finding people lost in the snow and helping them get home safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's what we wanted SimplyLouie to feel like. Not a cold robot. Not a corporate tool. A warm, reliable companion who shows up when you're stuck and helps you find your way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Louie is your Saint Bernard for daily life.</strong> Patient. Calm. Always there when you need help. Never judging you for asking.
