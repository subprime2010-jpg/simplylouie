            <h1>People Over Profit.</h1>
            <p>Technology was never supposed to leave people behind. So we built something different — simple, honest AI for the rest of us.</p>
            <a class="cta" href="https://t.me/LouieLifeBot">Start with SimplyLouie</a>

        <div class="block">
            <p><strong>Most people never get a fair start. Most people never get the tools the world expects them to magically have. SimplyLouie changes that — quietly, simply, and for everyone.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p>You don't need money, connections, or the "right background." You just need a phone and a reason to try. The rest is handled.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p><strong>This is the first time in history that everyday people get the same power the top 1% has had for years.</strong></p>

        <div class="block">
            <h2>Tech Was Never Meant to Be a Luxury</h2>
            <p>Somewhere along the way, technology became something only the wealthy, the connected, or the lucky could access. But most of us grew up without a safety net. No shortcuts. No head start. Just grit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h2>We Built This for the People Who Never Get Picked First</h2>
            <p>For the students sharing one phone in a family of five. For the workers grinding two jobs. For the parents doing everything they can with almost nothing. For the ones who were told to "figure it out" alone.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <h2>Because You Deserve a Fair Shot</h2>
            <p>SimplyLouie isn't a product. It's a promise — that powerful technology should belong to everyone, not just the people at the top. That your life, your dreams, and your future matter just as much as theirs.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- IDENTITY BLOCK -->
        <div class="block">
            <h2>For the Rest of Us</h2>
            <p>If you've ever felt overlooked, underestimated, or left out of the future — this is your moment. This is your movement. This is your seat at the table.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- TRUST BLOCK -->
        <div class="block">
            <h2>Why People Trust SimplyLouie</h2>
            <p>Because it's built for real life — not Silicon Valley fantasy. No confusing menus. No hidden fees. No "premium tiers." Just a tool that works, every time, on any phone, for anyone trying to move forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p>Every feature is designed for people who don't have time to waste. Students. Workers. Parents. Hustlers. Anyone fighting for a better life with the little they have.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p><strong>It's simple because life is already hard enough.</strong></p>

        <div class="block">
            <h2>Your Life Deserves a Turning Point</h2>
            <p>Every movement starts with one person deciding they're done waiting for permission. If you've read this far, you already know you're meant for more than the hand you were dealt.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p>You don't need perfect timing. You don't need the "right" background. You don't need anyone's approval. You just need a tool that finally works for you — not against you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p><strong>This is your moment to step forward. Quietly. Powerfully. On your terms.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>SimplyLouie is more than AI — it's a reminder that ordinary people deserve extraordinary tools.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
            <p>Built for the overlooked. Built for the underestimated. Built for the ones who keep going anyway.</p>

        <div class="block">
            <p><strong>We rise together — quietly, steadily, and without asking permission.</strong></p>
